# Social share plugin

## The goal is to create a WordPress plugin that displays social sharing buttons.

I plan to break down the project into three parts:
- Firstly, I'll create an MVP module that respects all the necessary functional requirements for the plugin.
- Secondly, I'll focus on designing an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for the plugin. This step is crucial because it must look good for both the website owner and visitors.
- Lastly, I will design the admin interface. To ensure flexibility, I may incorporate the Dragula JS library on the admin panel for ordering the social media icons.

## Additional
In addition, I will use Gulp with node-sass to streamline the plugin development process. This build tool will enable me to minify CSS and JS files, making the plugin lightweight and faster to load.

Overall, my goal is to create a user-friendly and efficient WordPress plugin that enhances website visitors' experience by providing social sharing buttons to share content on their favorite platforms.
